You’re in a room. It’s dark. Silent. As your eyes become accustomed to the gloom you notice something on the wall opposite. Squinting, you read:

404 Page Not Found

It might be written in blood or something. I don’t know. This story’s gone on too long already.

What I’m trying to say is the page you’re looking for, <code>{{ page.url }}</code>, can’t be found. Sorry.

You're probably looking for the most recent blog post called {% assign post = site.posts | first %}<a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>; but if you're completely lost, try the <a href="/">home page</a>. If you think I’ve made some kind of mistake (as unlikely as that sounds) you should <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">get in touch</a>.
