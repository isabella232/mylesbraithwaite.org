[Skyfield](http://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/ "Skyfield Python Library") is an pure Python astronomy package that makes it easy to get positions for planets and Earth satellites.

It's open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield "Skyfield GitHub Page") by [Brandon Rhodes](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes) and is easily installed with pip from the [CheeseShop](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/skyfield "Skyfield PyPi Page").

```python
from itertools import izip_longest

from skyfield import api # Skyfield Python Library

import requests # The *Best* HTTP Library for Python
```

---

```python
latitude, longitude = 43.659583, -79.397222
```

---

```python
req = requests.get('http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/stations.txt')
content = req.content

space_stations_data = []

# http://stackoverflow.com/a/16289922
def grouper(n, iterable, fillvalue=None):
    """Collect data into fixed-length chunks or blocks."""
    args = [iter(iterable)] * n
    return izip_longest(fillvalue=fillvalue, *args)

for i, g in enumerate(grouper(3, content.splitlines(), ''), 1):
    space_stations_data += ['\n'.join(g)]
```

```python
# Load the data where things are located.
eph = api.load('de421.bsp')

# Get the current time in fancy method.
julian_date = api.now()

# I want information for earth's prespective.
earth = eph['earth']

# I'm currently located at the Bahen Centre at UofT.
bahne = earth.topos(latitude, longitude)

space_stations = []

# Iterate over the list of space stations from NORAD.
for station in space_stations_data:
    # Get the name of the space station.
    name = station.splitlines()[0].strip()
    
    # Getting data from NORAD of the location of the Space Stations.
    data = earth.satellite(station)
    
    # This is my position, time and what I want to observe.
    space_stations += [{'name': name,
                  'position': bahne.at(utc=julian_date.utc).observe(data)}]
```

```python
station = space_stations[0]

ra, dec, distance = station.get('position').radec()

print(ra.hstr())
print dec.dstr()
print distance
